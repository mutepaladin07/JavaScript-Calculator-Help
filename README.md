# JavaScript-Calculator-Help
I am currently working on a project that needs an Age Calculator. So we decided that we need a "Date of Birth", "Current Age", and possibly "Age at Injury". These are to become TextField boxes that will populate into the field, when the User Inputs the data in a Date/Time Format. However, we wish to add a Date Picker with a nice calendar and icon for express usage. Now the script involve needs an "if-else" statement I gathered for verification that the field doesn't return an error when the user puts in an Age of Current / Age of Injury. So below is the code I have written and would like some feedback. I am new to an internship and would like some helpful tips and suggestions.
